# Workflow Orchestration

Sequential thinking methodology for complex problem-solving with dynamic adjustment.

## When to Apply

- Complex problem decomposition
- Adaptive planning with revision capability
- Analysis needing course correction
- Problems with unclear/emerging scope
- Multi-step solutions requiring context maintenance
- Hypothesis-driven investigation

## Core Process

### 1. Start with Loose Estimate
```
Thought 1/5: [Initial analysis]
```
Adjust dynamically as understanding evolves.

### 2. Structure Each Thought
- Build on previous context explicitly
- Address one aspect per thought
- State assumptions, uncertainties, realizations
- Signal what next thought should address

### 3. Apply Dynamic Adjustment
- **Expand**: More complexity discovered → increase total
- **Contract**: Simpler than expected → decrease total
- **Revise**: New insight invalidates previous → mark revision
- **Branch**: Multiple approaches → explore alternatives

### 4. Use Revision When Needed
```
Thought 5/8 [REVISION of Thought 2]: [Corrected understanding]
- Original: [What was stated]
- Why revised: [New insight]
- Impact: [What changes]
```

### 5. Branch for Alternatives
```
Thought 4/7 [BRANCH A]: [Approach A]
Thought 4/7 [BRANCH B]: [Approach B]
```
Compare explicitly, converge with decision rationale.

### 6. Generate & Verify Hypotheses
```
Thought 6/9 [HYPOTHESIS]: [Proposed solution]
Thought 7/9 [VERIFICATION]: [Test results]
```
Iterate until hypothesis verified.

### 7. Complete Only When Ready
Mark final: `Thought N/N [FINAL]`

Complete when:
- Solution verified
- All critical aspects addressed
- Confidence achieved
- No outstanding uncertainties

## Application Modes

**Explicit**: Use visible thought markers when complexity warrants visible reasoning.

**Implicit**: Apply methodology internally for routine problem-solving.

## Multi-Agent Coordination

For complex tasks, coordinate multiple agents:

1. **Parallel Research**: Spawn multiple research agents for different aspects
2. **Sequential Planning**: Use planner after research synthesis
3. **Validation Loop**: Debug → Fix → Test → Review cycle
4. **Documentation**: Update docs after successful implementation

## Workflow Templates

### Feature Implementation
1. Research existing patterns
2. Plan architecture changes
3. Implement incrementally
4. Test each component
5. Code review
6. Documentation update

### Bug Investigation
1. Reproduce consistently
2. Form hypotheses
3. Test systematically
4. Implement fix
5. Verify and test
6. Document root cause

### Architecture Decision
1. Define requirements
2. Research alternatives
3. Evaluate trade-offs
4. Make decision
5. Document rationale
6. Plan implementation
