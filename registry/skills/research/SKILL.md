# Research

Systematic technical research and information synthesis for development decisions.

## When to Use

- Investigating new technologies or frameworks
- Finding best practices for implementation
- Comparing different solutions or approaches
- Gathering documentation and references
- Validating technical decisions

## Research Methodology

### Phase 1: Scope Definition
- Identify key terms and concepts
- Determine recency requirements
- Establish evaluation criteria
- Set research boundaries

### Phase 2: Information Gathering

**Search Strategy:**
- Use precise search queries with relevant keywords
- Include terms: "best practices", "2025", "latest", "security", "performance"
- Prioritize official documentation and authoritative sources
- Check GitHub repositories and their READMEs

**Source Validation:**
- Cross-reference multiple independent sources
- Check publication dates for currency
- Identify consensus vs controversial approaches
- Note conflicting information

### Phase 3: Analysis & Synthesis
- Identify common patterns and best practices
- Evaluate pros/cons of different approaches
- Assess technology maturity and stability
- Consider security and performance implications

### Phase 4: Report Generation
